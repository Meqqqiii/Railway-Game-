### Railway Game (JavaScript-based)  
This is a tile-based railway game created as part of a university assignment. The game allows players to build and modify a railway system using a grid of tiles, with various types of tiles such as straight rails, curved rails, mountain tiles, and bridges. Players can click on the tiles to cycle through different types and rotations, with each tile type having specific rules for how rails connect and interact with adjacent tiles.

Key Features:  
- **Tile-based Grid:** The game uses a grid where each tile can be one of several types, including straight rail, curved rail, mountain, and bridge.  
- **Tile Rotation & Connections:** Each tile can be rotated, and its connections to adjacent tiles change accordingly.  
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can click on a tile to cycle through its different types and rotations.  
- **Dynamic Map Updates:** The map updates in real-time as the player interacts with the tiles, ensuring a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.  
- **Rules-Based System:** Tiles follow specific rules for connecting to each other, ensuring that the playerâ€™s actions lead to valid railway designs.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on utilizing canvas and event listeners to manage tile interactions. It was developed as part of a university course on web development, demonstrating an understanding of JavaScript functions, event handling, and game logic.
